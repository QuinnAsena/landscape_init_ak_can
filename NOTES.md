## Resolved Spatial Challenges

### Grid alignment (stand.grid ↔ env.grid)
- A snap grid (100×100 and 10×10) was introduced to ensure pixel-exact alignment between the stand grid and environment grid.
- Direct CRS reassignment after `disagg()` caused misalignment; solution uses explicit reprojection.
- Details: `description.qmd`, scripts `02` and `10–11`.

### Landscape buffering for climate and DEM
- in order to create the climate link file, the climate data are buffered to a larger area than the environment grid and then extracted against the grid points. The alternative of interpolating the climate to the resources unit grain works but creates files that are 100 times larger.
- DEM data are also downloaded to a buffered area in order to calculate aspect without edge pixels becoming NA.

### terra quirks
- Various `terra` version-specific behaviours encountered and resolved; specifics documented inline in scripts.

## ABoVE surface water data artefacts (script 09)

### 2026-04-24 — All-water epochs in ABoVE surface water tiles
**Context:** Running `09_species_init.r` across all 31 land cover years revealed that
certain landscape/decade combinations produce a surface water raster where every cell
equals 1 (all-water), rather than the expected classes: 0 = land, 1 = Water,
2 = probable water in Alaska1991 tiles, 255 = No data.
**Decision/Finding:** This is a documented data quality issue. The ABoVE Water Map
Alaska 1991 fill procedure (applied to tiles h00v00, h00v01, h01v00) can propagate
water values (value 2 = probable water) across areas with no 1991 observations. For
some landscapes this results in an all-water epoch for one or more decades.
Map file cell values: 0 = land, 1 = water, 2 = probable water (Alaska 1991 tiles
only), 255 = no data. Value 2 is treated as water in the masking step.
**Why:** A decade where all cells equal 1 produces a mask that eliminates the entire
landscape, which is incorrect. The fix (in `09_species_init.r`) validates each decade
before use: a valid decade must have both land (0) and water (1/2) cells. If the
nominated decade is invalid, the nearest valid decade is used instead. If all three
decades are invalid, the script falls back to ABoVE land cover class 15 (water) to
derive the 50m buffer mask.

## HPC Deployment (Derecho)

### 2026-06-03 — Sequential batch submission via PBS afterok dependency chain
**Context:** Running all 36 remaining replicates (landscapes 03–06, reps 4–12) in parallel caused disk I/O contention on Derecho scratch. The working limit is 6 reps at a time (2 nodes × 3 reps/node via `launch_cf --steps-per-node 3`).
**Decision/Finding:** Automated sequential submission using PBS `afterok` dependency chaining. `submit_chain.sh` splits the 36 commands across 6 cmdfiles (`cmdfile_b01.sh`–`cmdfile_b06.sh`, 6 lines each) and chains them: each batch is held (`H`) until the previous finishes. `launch_cf` passes unrecognised flags through to `qsub`, so `-W depend=afterok:JOBID` works directly. Critical gotcha: `launch_cf` prints verbose diagnostic text to stdout before the job ID, so the job ID must be extracted with `| tail -1` when capturing via `$()`.
**Why:** Queue wait times of 12–18 hours make manual re-submission expensive; the chain runs unattended once submitted.

## Known Fragilities (from `issues-codex5.3.md`)

Not urgent for controlled pipeline runs, but worth awareness:

- **Script 00/01:** Column name inconsistency (`Propforested` vs `Propforest`, `Suppression` spelling)
- **Script 10:** `sapinit_dict` written to empirical input folder — should go to output folder
- **Script 12:** Climate table-name contract (RU-keyed vs climate-grid-keyed) needs locking
- **Scripts 05/06/11/12:** Missing input validation (optional hardening)
